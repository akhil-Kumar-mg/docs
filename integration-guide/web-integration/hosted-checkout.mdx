## Prerequisites

Before integrating EximPe Hosted Checkout, ensure you have:

- **Merchant Account**: An active EximPe merchant account
- **Credentials**: Your merchant ID and API key
- **Test Environment**: Test environment credentials (for development)
- **Domain Whitelist**: Whitelisted your website domain for integration

## Integration Steps

The integration process consists of three essential steps:

### Step 1: Creating an Order

Create an order from your backend server before initiating payment:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.eximpe.com/pg/orders/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Client-ID: YOUR_CLIENT_ID" \
  -d '{
    "amount": "1000.00",
    "currency": "INR",
    "reference_id": "TEST_5YUIQT",
    "return_url": "https://your-website.com/payment/callback",
    "mop_type": "UPI",
    "buyer": {
        "name": "John Doe",
        "email": "john.doe@example.com",
        "phone": "+919876543210"
    }
}'
```

```json Response
{
    "success": true,
    "message": "Checkout session created successfully",
    "data": {
        "session_id": "b4db5e1c82db8636094f54e3293218172ae2ab87dee6ce4e97c82db6c63f243a",
        "order_id": "OD5916184980"
    }
}
```

</CodeGroup>

</Note>

### Step 2: Opening the Checkout Page

<Steps>
  <Step title="Include JS SDK">
    To integrate the EximPe Checkout, include our JavaScript SDK in your HTML:
    
    ```html
    <script src="https://cdn.eximpe.com/sdk/eximpe-sdk.min.js"></script>
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Initialize the SDK">
    Initialize the SDK with your environment mode:
    
    ```javascript
    const eximpe = EximPe({
        mode: "sandbox" // or "production"
    });
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Open EximPe Checkout">
    To open the checkout, you can use the **eximpe.checkout()** method:
    
    ```javascript
    eximpe.checkout({
      sessionId: "your-session-id",
      redirectTarget: "_self"
    });
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

#### Checkout Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `sessionId` | string | Yes | Received from Create Payment Session Response |
| `redirectTarget` | string | No | Controls how the payment page opens |

#### Redirect Target Options

| Property Value | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `_self` (default) | Opens in the same frame |
| `_blank` | Opens in a new window/tab |
| `_top` | Opens in the full window |
| `_modal` | Opens in a popup window |
| DOM element | Opens within a specified element |

#### Complete Example

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>EximPe Checkout Integration</title>
    <script src="https://cdn.eximpe.com/sdk/eximpe-sdk.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <div>
        <button id="payButton">Pay Now</button>
    </div>
    <script>
        const eximpe = EximPe({
            mode: "production"
        });

        document.getElementById("payButton").addEventListener("click", () => {
            const checkoutOptions = {
                sessionId: "your-session-id",
                redirectTarget: "_self"
            };
            eximpe.checkout(checkoutOptions);
        });
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

<Warning>
  For Popup & Inline Checkout, handle the promise returned by **eximpe.checkout()** to execute code after payment completion.
</Warning>

### Step 3: Confirming the Payment

After payment completion, verify the payment status:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Redirect Checkout">
    <ul>
      <li>Customer is redirected to your return URL (provided during session creation)</li>
      <li>Always include a return URL for better user experience</li>
      <li>Add order context in the return URL for easy identification</li>
    </ul>
  </Card>
  <Card title="Popup & Inline Checkout">
    <ul>
      <li>Handle the promise returned by <code>eximpe.checkout()</code></li>
      <li>Execute additional code after payment completion</li>
    </ul>
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

#### Payment Status Verification

Verify the payment status using the session ID from your backend:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.eximpe.com/api/v1/payment/verify/{session_id} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

<Warning>
  **Important:** Always verify the payment status before delivering services. A payment is considered successful when the status is "completed".
</Warning>

## Security Notes

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Transaction Validation">
    After receiving a response from EximPe, you must validate the transaction by verifying the hash or signature (if applicable) against what you sent in the request. This ensures the transaction is secure and untampered.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Additional Security">
    EximPe recommends implementing transaction details APIs and webhooks/callbacks as an extra security measure. For more information, refer to the [Verify Payment API](/api-reference/hosted-checkout) and Webhooks documentation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Record Reconciliation">
    Always reconcile your records with EximPe's database after you receive the response. Use the verification APIs to confirm transaction details.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Sensitive Information">
    **Never include sensitive information** (such as salt values or plain text hash strings) in the payment request to EximPe. Sensitive information should always be kept secure and never transmitted to the client or as part of the payment request.
  </Card>
