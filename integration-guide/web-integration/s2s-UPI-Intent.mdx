# Introduction

The Server-to-Server integration is performed at the server level, that is, your server (merchant server) and EximPe server. The transaction is initiated from your server; hence redirection hop is eliminated. Since the details are captured on your page, customers gain confidence and enhance the checkout experience.

The following steps allow you to integrate the server-to-server UPI intent:

1. Initiate payment
2. Invoke UPI Intent on customer’s device
3. Check UPI transaction status
4. EximPe sends Server-to-Server callback response
