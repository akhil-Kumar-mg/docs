## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Merchant Key & Salt**: Your EximPe merchant key and salt for hash generation.  
- **Callback URL**: A publicly accessible URL configured in your EximPe dashboard for server-to-server callbacks.  
- **cURL or HTTP Client**: Capability to make HTTPS `POST` and `GET` requests from your server.  
- **UPI Knowledge**: Familiarity with UPI intent URL parameters and encoding.

## Integration Steps

The integration consists of four steps:

### Step 1: Initiate Payment

Make a server-to-server `POST` to create a UPI intent transaction:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.eximpe.com/payment/s2s/upi \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Client-Key: YOUR_CLIENT_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "key": "YOUR_MERCHANT_KEY",
    "txnid": "TXN123456",
    "amount": "1000.00",
    "productinfo": "Order Description",
    "firstname": "John",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "phone": "9876543210",
    "pg": "UPI",
    "bankcode": "INTENT",
    "txn_s2s_flow": 4,
    "s2s_client_ip": "203.0.113.5",
    "s2s_device_info": "Mozilla/5.0...",

}'
