## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Merchant Key & Salt**: Your EximPe merchant key and salt for hash generation.  
- **Callback URL**: A publicly accessible URL configured in your EximPe dashboard for server-to-server callbacks.  
- **cURL or HTTP Client**: Capability to make HTTPS `POST` and `GET` requests from your server.  
- **UPI Knowledge**: Familiarity with UPI intent URL parameters and encoding.

The following steps allow you to integrate the server-to-server UPI intent:

1. Initiate payment
2. Invoke UPI Intent on customer’s device
3. Check UPI transaction status
4. EximPe sends Server-to-Server callback response
